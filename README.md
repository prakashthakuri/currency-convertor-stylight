# Frontend Developer task

- Your task is to implement a basic currency converter which converts values between Euro, US Dollar and Japanese Yen.
- As the markup is not very elaborate, improve it as much as possible and apply best practices.
- Also the stylesheet can make use of some improvements. Improve and enhance it as much as possible. Do not use any post- or pre-processors for your styles, and do not use any styling libraries like Bootstrap or Foundation.
- In the JavaScript you should talk to the API endpoint for the currency conversion (use [fixer.io](http://fixer.io/) for this and make the Ajax calls with [`axios`](https://github.com/axios/axios) which is included at the bottom of the `index.html` file). Do not use any other libraries or frameworks like jQuery, Angular, React, etc.
- Improve the UI and ensure the interface works for multiple device types.
- As the solution must only work on the latest Chrome version, you can make use of ES6 features and new CSS technologies without thinking about transpiling or vendor-prefixing things. Of course you do not have to use fancy new stuff, but it is a bonus.

Bonus:
- Show a history of conversion inputs.
- Keep the history persistent on browser reload.
